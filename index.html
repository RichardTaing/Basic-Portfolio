      <p>Welcome to the Random Phrase and Idiom Generator. There will be times when you may need more than a random word
        for what you want to accomplish, and this free online tool can help. The use of this tool is quite simple. All
        you
        need to do is indicate the number of random phrases you'd like to be displayed, and then hit the "Generate
        Random
        Phrases" button. Once done, your chosen number of idioms will be displayed along with the meaning of the idiom.
      </p>

      <p>Idioms are a wonderful part of the English language that give it a lot of flavor. They force people to know
        more
        than the literal meaning of words. Idioms are commonly used phrases which have a meaning completely different
        than
        their literal meaning. This can be quite confusing to those who aren't familiar with the idiom and those who are
        studying English.</p>
